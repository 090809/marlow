### Contributing to [Marlow]

Thank you for your interest in [marlow]! This is an open source project; pull requests and issues are welcome from all.

The codebase's [travis ci build][travis] is set up to mimic the same check suite as the [goreportcard] website, so
every PR will be subject to those standards, as well as maintaining the code coverage level configured at [codecov.io].

If you are interested in contributing, please familiarize yourself with the automation tools the project has configured
for continuous integration _before_ opening a pull request; while not absolutely necessary, it will save you some
surprises when you do open a pull request that could've been mitigated locally.
